## By Persona (Manual Prompts) / By Plugin (Orchestrate)

When using `/orchestrate`, plugins handle each phase automatically. When using manual prompts from `04-prompts/`, use the persona-based workflow:

| Phase | `/orchestrate` Plugin | Manual Prompt Persona |
|-------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Explore/Define | `superpowers:brainstorming` | Product Owner (1.1) |
| Plan/Design | `superpowers:writing-plans` | Solutions Architect (1.2) |
| Build | `superpowers:test-driven-development` | Specialist Developer (2.2) |
| Review | `pr-review-toolkit:review-pr` | QA Engineer (3.1) |
| Document | Technical Writer agent | Technical Writer (4.1) |

---

## Comprehensive vs. Specialized Prompts

### When to use COMPREHENSIVE review (3.1)
- You want broad feedback
- First review of new code
- Pre-merge check
- Not sure what's wrong

### When to use SPECIALIZED reviews (3.2-3.5)
- You have a specific concern (security, performance, bugs)
- You want deep analysis on one dimension
- Comprehensive review identified an issue you want to explore deeper

**Tip:** Use comprehensive first, then specialized for deep dives.

---

## Linear Workflow (Recommended)

For a typical feature, use prompts in this order:

```
1. 1.1 Product Owner          (Create PRD)
    ↓
2. 1.2 Solutions Architect    (Create Tech Spec)
    ↓
3. 2.1 Generate Task List     (Break into tasks)
    ↓
4. 2.2 Iterative Implementation (Task #1)
    ↓
5. 2.2 Iterative Implementation (Task #2)
    ↓
   ... (repeat for each task)
    ↓
6. 3.1 QA Comprehensive Review (Review all code)
    ↓
7. (Optional) 3.2-3.5 Specialized Reviews
    ↓
8. (Optional) 3.6 Refactor Consultation
    ↓
9. 4.1 or 4.2 Documentation
    ↓
DONE
```

## Prompt Selection by Experience Level

Choose prompts based on your experience with AI-driven development:

### 🌱 Beginner (Week 1 - Learning the Basics)

**Your focus:** Learn the core workflow, build confidence, ship simple features

**Essential prompts (3-5 files):**

**Option A: Quick Start (Recommended for first 2-3 features)**
- `/quick-start/simple-workflow.md` - Combined PRD + planning
- `/quick-start/process-task-list.md` - Interactive task generation
- Manual testing only

**Start here:** [`/quick-start/README.md`](../quick-start/README.md)

**OR Option B: Standard Minimal Flow**
1. `1.1-product-owner-prd.md` (Simplified - keep it to 3-5 user stories)
2. `2.1-generate-task-list.md` (Use interactive mode)
3. `2.2-iterative-implementation.md` (With heavy guidance - ask questions)

**Skip for now:**
- ❌ Tech specs (1.2) - Not needed for simple features
- ❌ Database/API design (1.3, 1.4) - Keep it simple
- ❌ Formal reviews (3.x) - Manual testing is fine
- ❌ Documentation generation (4.x) - Write simple README yourself

**What success looks like:**
- ✅ Built 2-3 simple features (task tracker, expense log, basic CRUD)
- ✅ Understand PRD → Tasks → Implementation flow
- ✅ Comfortable with one-task-at-a-time approach
- ✅ Features work (even if not perfect)

---

### 📈 Intermediate (Week 2-4 - Adding Quality)

**Your focus:** Build for others, add quality controls, handle complexity

**Add to your toolkit (8 core prompts):**

**Phase 1 - Planning:**
1. `1.1-product-owner-prd.md` (Full PRDs now, 5-10 user stories)
2. `1.2-architect-tech-spec.md` (Before complex features)

**Phase 2 - Implementation:**
3. `2.1-generate-task-list.md` (Interactive mode)
4. `2.2-iterative-implementation.md`

**Phase 3 - Review (New!):**
5. `3.1-qa-comprehensive-review.md` ⭐ **Start using this before shipping**

**Phase 4 - Documentation (New!):**
6. `4.1-readme-generator.md` ⭐ **For projects you'll maintain**

**When to use what:**
- **Always:** PRD (1.1), Tasks (2.1), Implementation (2.2)
- **Before complex features:** Tech Spec (1.2)
- **Before shipping to others:** QA Review (3.1)
- **For maintained projects:** README (4.1)

**Optional but helpful:**
- `1.3-architect-database-design.md` - If database has >5 tables or complex relationships
- `1.4-architect-api-design.md` - If building a public API
- `2.3-code-commenter.md` - If code is hard to understand

**Skip for now:**
- Specialized reviews (3.2-3.5) - Comprehensive review (3.1) covers most cases
- Refactor consultation (3.6) - Only if you're rewriting significant code
- User guides (4.2) - Only if you have non-technical users

**What success looks like:**
- ✅ Built 5-10 features using the standard workflow
- ✅ Code passes QA review with minimal critical issues
- ✅ Comfortable creating tech specs for medium-complexity features
- ✅ Projects have clear README documentation
- ✅ Others can use what you've built

## Migration Path: Quick Start → Standard → Full

### Week 1-2: Quick Start
```
You: Use /quick-start/simple-workflow.md
Goal: Build 2-3 simple features, learn basics
Output: Working features (may have rough edges)
```

### Week 3-4: Transition to Standard
```
You: 1.1 (PRD) → 1.2 (Tech Spec - for complex features) → 2.1 → 2.2 → 3.1 (Review!)
Goal: Build for others, add quality controls
Output: Professional features that others can use
```

### Month 2+: Graduate to Full Framework
```
You: All prompts as needed, specialized reviews for high-risk
Goal: Production-ready systems, handle anything
Output: Enterprise-grade features
```

**Remember:** You can always go back to Quick Start for simple internal tools. Use the right tool for the job!
